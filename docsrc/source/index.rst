Arduino Home Assistant integration
==================================================

ArduinoHA allows to integrate an Arduino/ESP based device with Home Assistant using MQTT.
The library is designed to use as few resources (RAM/flash) as possible.
Initially, it was optimized to work on Arduino Uno with Ethernet Shield,
but I successfully use it on ESP8266/ESP8255 boards in my projects.
